# Setting Up Planning Reminders Cron Job on Railway

## Overview
The planning reminders feature sends SMS reminders to users on the days they've selected in their account settings.

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Using Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Railway project dashboard**
   - Navigate to https://railway.app/project/[your-project-id]

2. **Create a new Cron Job service**
   - Click "+ New" in your project
   - Select "Empty Service"
   - Name it "reminder-cron"

3. **Configure the Cron Job**
   - Go to the service settings
   - Under "Variables", add all the same environment variables from your main service:
     - `DATABASE_URL` (should auto-reference from main service)
     - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
     - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
     - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
     - `APP_BASE_URL`
   
4. **Set the Cron Schedule**
   - In the service settings, go to "Deployments"
   - Set the "Start Command" to: `python3 send_reminders.py`
   - Click on "Settings" > "Cron Schedule"
   - Enter the cron expression: `0 9 * * *` (runs daily at 9 AM UTC)
     - For 9 AM EST (Eastern): `0 14 * * *` (9 AM EST = 2 PM UTC)
     - For 9 AM PST (Pacific): `0 17 * * *` (9 AM PST = 5 PM UTC)

5. **Deploy the Cron Service**
   - The service should automatically deploy from your GitHub repo
   - Railway will run the cron job on the specified schedule

### Option 2: Using Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Create cron service
railway service create reminder-cron

# Set environment variables (reference from main service)
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=${{DATABASE_URL}}
railway variables set TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=${{TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID}}
railway variables set TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=${{TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN}}
railway variables set TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=${{TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER}}
railway variables set APP_BASE_URL=${{APP_BASE_URL}}

# Deploy
railway up
```

## Cron Schedule Examples

- `0 9 * * *` - Daily at 9:00 AM UTC
- `0 9 * * 1-5` - Weekdays at 9:00 AM UTC
- `0 9 * * 1,3,5` - Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 9:00 AM UTC
- `0 9,17 * * *` - Daily at 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM UTC

## Testing the Cron Job

Test the reminder script locally:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the reminder script
python3 send_reminders.py
```

## How It Works

1. The cron job runs on the schedule you set (e.g., daily at 9 AM)
2. It checks the current day of the week
3. It queries all users from the database
4. For each user who has today in their `reminder_days` preferences
5. It sends an SMS reminder with a link to the app
6. Example message: "Hi John! üëã Time to plan your weekend with friends. Start here: https://trygatherly.com"

## Monitoring

- Check Railway logs for the cron service to see reminder sending activity
- Look for:
  - `‚úÖ SMS sent to [phone]: [message_sid]`
  - `‚úÖ Sent X reminder(s)`
- Any errors will be logged with `‚ùå`

## Troubleshooting

**No reminders being sent?**
- Check that users have set reminder preferences in Settings
- Verify the cron schedule matches your desired time
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly

**Wrong timezone?**
- Railway cron jobs run in UTC
- Convert your desired local time to UTC for the cron schedule
- Example: 9 AM PST = 5 PM UTC (during standard time)
